# NAME

Class::Simple::Cached - cache messages to an object

# VERSION

Version 0.04

# SYNOPSIS

A sub-class of [Class::Simple](https://metacpan.org/pod/Class%3A%3ASimple) which caches calls to read
the status of an object that are otherwise expensive.

It is up to the caller to maintain the cache if the object comes out of sync with the cache,
for example by changing its state.

You can use this class to create a caching layer to an object of any class
that works on objects with a get/set model such as:

    use Class::Simple;
    my $obj = Class::Simple->new();
    $obj->val($newval);
    $oldval = $obj->val();

# SUBROUTINES/METHODS

## new

Creates a Class::Simple::Cached object.

It takes one mandatory parameter: cache,
which is either an object which understands clear(), get() and set() calls,
such as an [CHI](https://metacpan.org/pod/CHI) object;
or is a reference to a hash where the return values are to be stored.

It takes one optional argument: object,
which is an object which is taken to be the object to be cached.
If not given, an object of the class [Class::Simple](https://metacpan.org/pod/Class%3A%3ASimple) is instantiated
and that is used.

# BUGS

Doesn't work with [Memoize](https://metacpan.org/pod/Memoize).

Only works on messages that take no arguments.
